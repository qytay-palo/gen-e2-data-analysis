## Executive Summary

Currently, **MOH financial planning teams and healthcare policy makers** face **limited understanding of what drives healthcare expenditure growth (e.g., population aging, service intensity, technology adoption, or disease prevalence)**, which prevents **targeted cost control interventions and leads to broad budget cuts that may harm care quality**. By **analyzing 15 years of national health expenditure data (2005-2020) alongside demographic trends, utilization patterns, and disease burden metrics**, we can **identify primary cost drivers, decompose expenditure growth components, and detect inefficient spending patterns** resulting in **evidence-based cost containment strategies that preserve quality while controlling budget growth**.

---

## Problem Statement Hypothesis (Value Proposition)

> We believe that **multi-dimensional diagnostic analysis of healthcare expenditure patterns for MOH financial planners and policy makers** will achieve **identification of top cost drivers, quantification of expenditure growth components, and detection of cost control opportunities**. We'll know we're successful when we see **cost containment policies targeting our identified drivers and budget allocation decisions referencing our expenditure decomposition analysis**.

## Objectives

**Objective 1**: Quantify healthcare expenditure growth patterns and trends (2005-2020)
- Analyze total national health expenditure evolution ($, per capita, % GDP)
- Decompose expenditure by sector (public vs private)
- Calculate compound annual growth rates and identify inflection points

**Objective 2**: Identify primary drivers of expenditure growth through decomposition analysis
- Separate demographic effects (population aging, size) from intensity effects (cost per case)
- Quantify contribution of volume growth (more cases) vs price growth (cost per case)
- Assess impact of disease prevalence changes on expenditure patterns

**Objective 3**: Diagnose inefficiencies and cost control opportunities
- Compare Singapore's expenditure trends against international benchmarks (where data available)
- Identify expenditure categories with above-average growth rates
- Detect potential over-utilization or high-cost service patterns

**Objective 4**: Recommend targeted cost containment strategies
- Prioritize cost drivers amenable to policy intervention

## Data Requirements (High-Level)

**Critical Considerations**:

**✅ Data Availability CONFIRMED** (Reference: `docs/project_context/data-sources.md`):

**Expenditure Data:**
  - `national-health-expenditure-per-annum.csv` (16 records, 2005-2020, total expenditure trends)
  - `health-financing-by-financing-schemes.csv` (30 records, detailed financing mechanism breakdowns)
  - Other expenditure tables likely available (to be confirmed during data exploration)

**Utilization Data (for driver decomposition):**
  - `hospital-admission-rate-by-age-and-sex.csv` (216 records, volume trends)
  - `residential-long-term-care-admissions.csv` (25 records, long-term care utilization)
  - `subsidised-primary-care-attendances-at-polyclinics.csv` (62 records, primary care volume)

**Disease Burden Data (for prevalence impact):**
  - Multiple mortality and disease-specific datasets available
  - Can proxy disease burden changes

**Demographic Context:**
  - Can derive population trends from per-capita expenditure and utilization denominators
  - Age structure insights from age-stratified utilization data

**✅ Data Completeness**: 100% completeness, no missing values

**✅ Data Quality**: Official MOH source via data.gov.sg, validated government statistics

**✅ Data Granularity**:

- **Temporal**: Annual data (2005-2020) - SUITABLE for expenditure trend analysis
- **Expenditure Breakdown**: Financing schemes (government subsidies, MediShield, Medisave, out-of-pocket); sector (public/private) likely available
- **Demographics**: Age, gender stratification available in utilization data for driver decomposition

**⚠️ Known Limitations**:
- **Service-Level Costs**: May not have detailed cost per procedure/service; aggregate expenditure only
- **International Benchmarking**: Will need external data sources for comparisons (WHO, OECD)
- **Attribution**: Difficult to isolate causal effects (e.g., technology costs vs intensity vs prevalence)

**Privacy/Security**: Aggregated financial and utilization statistics - NO privacy concerns

**No Data Blockers Identified** - Core expenditure and utilization data confirmed available

## Initial Considerations

**Analytical Approach**:
- **Type**: Diagnostic analytics using decomposition methods and root cause analysis
- **Methods**: 
  - Expenditure growth decomposition (demographic vs intensity vs price effects)
  - Trend analysis and change point detection (identify when growth accelerated)
  - Correlation analysis (expenditure vs utilization, demographics, disease burden)
  - Comparative benchmarking (if international data obtained)
  - Econometric modeling (optional - if causal inference needed)
- **Complexity**: Moderate - requires multi-source integration and statistical decomposition

**Platform Feasibility** (Reference: `docs/project_context/tech-stack.md`):

**✅ Platform Requirements VERIFIED**:
- **Primary Platform**: HEALIX/Databricks - ✅ Confirmed in tech stack
- **Primary Language**: Python (Polars for data integration) - ✅ Preferred in tech stack

  - Data manipulation: Polars (confirmed)
  - Statistical analysis: statsmodels, scipy.stats for decomposition and trend analysis
  - Econometrics: STATA available if advanced econometric modeling needed
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly for expenditure trend charts
- **Decomposition Methods**: Index decomposition analysis (IDA) using Python (custom implementation or libraries like intensity_decomposition)

**Technical Feasibility**: ✅ **CONFIRMED - No gaps identified**
- Multi-table data integration: Polars excels at joins
- Decomposition analysis: Standard Python statistical libraries
- Trend detection: scipy.signal, statsmodels for change point detection
- Visualization: Rich charting capabilities with Plotly/Matplotlib

**Platform Constraints**: None - suitable for standard Python environment

## Dependencies and Assumptions

**Problem Statement Dependencies**: None (independent analysis)

**Related Problem Statements**:
- **May complement PS-003 (Capacity Optimization)** - capacity expansion has cost implications
- **May inform PS-001 (Workforce Sustainability)** - workforce costs are major expenditure component
- Could lead to future prescriptive analysis on optimal healthcare financing design

**Key Assumptions**:

**⚠️ CRITICAL - These are analytical assumptions, NOT data assumptions**:

- **Assumption 1**: Expenditure growth can be meaningfully decomposed into demographic, volume, and price components using available aggregate data
  - **Validation approach**: Apply standard decomposition methods (Laspeyres index); clearly document methodology and acknowledge approximations
  
- **Assumption 2**: Correlation between utilization and expenditure changes reflects causal relationships
  - **Mitigation**: Clearly state correlations do NOT prove causation; recommend further causal analysis for critical drivers

- **Assumption 3**: Historical expenditure patterns (2005-2020) are informative for future cost control despite COVID-19 and healthcare system evolution
  - **Mitigation**: Separate pre-COVID baseline (2005-2019) analysis; discuss COVID-19 and pandemic preparedness cost implications

- **Assumption 4**: International benchmarking is meaningful despite healthcare system differences
  - **Mitigation**: If conducted, acknowledge system differences; focus on directional insights rather than absolute comparisons

**Data has been VERIFIED against `data-sources.md` - no data assumptions made**

## Risks and Open Questions

**Potential Blockers**:
1. **Risk**: Limited expenditure granularity - may have total expenditure only without detailed service-level breakdown
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on sector and financing scheme analysis; acknowledge service-level analysis as future enhancement
   
2. **Risk**: Decomposition requires assumptions about which factors to attribute growth to; methodology is somewhat subjective
   - **Mitigation**: Apply multiple decomposition methods; conduct sensitivity analysis; clearly document methodology

3. **Risk**: COVID-19 (2020+) fundamentally changed expenditure patterns (pandemic costs, deferred care, telehealth)
   - **Mitigation**: Separate pre-COVID baseline analysis; discuss pandemic implications as special case

4. **Risk**: International benchmarking data may not be readily available or comparable
   - **Mitigation**: Make benchmarking optional/supplementary; focus primarily on Singapore's internal trends

**Open Questions for Stakeholder Clarification**:
1. What expenditure growth rate is considered "sustainable" or target growth rate for budget planning?
2. Are there known major policy changes during 2005-2020 that should be annotated (e.g., MediShield Life launch in 2015)?
3. What level of expenditure detail is available (total only, or breakdowns by service type/care setting)?
4. Is international benchmarking a priority, and which countries are most relevant for comparison (Malaysia, Hong Kong, other Asian high-income)?
5. Are there specific cost categories of particular concern (e.g., pharmaceutical costs, specialist care, long-term care)?
