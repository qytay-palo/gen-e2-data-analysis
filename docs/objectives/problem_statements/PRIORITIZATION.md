# Problem Statement Prioritization Analysis

**Date**: 2026-03-11  
**Author**: Data Analysis Team  
**Purpose**: Objective prioritization of identified problem statements for Gen-E2 Singapore Health Trends Analysis Project

---

## Prioritization Framework

Each problem statement is scored on three dimensions (1-5 scale):

- **Business Value (BV)**: Alignment with MOH strategic goals, stakeholder impact, decision-enabling power
- **Feasibility (F)**: Data availability, technical complexity, resource requirements, timeline
- **Urgency (U)**: Stakeholder pain points, time sensitivity, policy deadlines, dependencies

**Total Priority Score** = (BV × 0.4) + (F × 0.3) + (U × 0.3)  
*Business Value weighted higher as primary driver*

**Priority Categorization**:
- **P0 (Critical)**: Score ≥ 4.0 - Immediate start, highest resource allocation
- **P1 (High)**: Score 3.0-3.9 - Near-term start, significant resources
- **P2 (Medium)**: Score 2.0-2.9 - Planned start after P0/P1, moderate resources
- **P3 (Low)**: Score < 2.0 - Future consideration, minimal resources

## Problem Statement Scoring

### PS-001: Healthcare Workforce Sustainability Analysis (Predictive)

**Business Value: 5/5**
- **Direct alignment** with MOH strategic goal: "Ensure sustainable healthcare system" (business-objectives.md)
- **Critical stakeholder need**: Workforce planning for healthcare sustainability (explicit in project context)
- **High-impact decisions enabled**: 10-year workforce projections inform recruitment, training pipelines, immigration policies
- **Strategic importance**: Workforce shortages have system-wide cascading effects
- **Justification**: Workforce is the #1 healthcare system resource; shortages cannot be quickly remedied

**Feasibility: 4/5**
- **Data availability**: ✅ 7 workforce tables confirmed (2006-2019), 13 years of historical data
- **Data quality**: ✅ 100% complete, official MOH source
- **Technical complexity**: Moderate - Time series forecasting is well-established; Python libraries (statsmodels, Prophet) mature
- **Resource requirements**: Medium - Single analyst with forecasting expertise; 5-7 sprints estimated
- **Known constraints**: Data ends 2019; COVID-19 may have altered workforce trends (mitigation: scenario modeling)
- **Justification**: Standard forecasting problem with good data; -1 for COVID-19 uncertainty

**Urgency: 4/5**
- **Stakeholder urgency**: High - Healthcare workforce shortages are current pain point globally and in Singapore
- **Time sensitivity**: Medium-High - Workforce planning requires 5-10 year lead time for training pipelines
- **Policy deadlines**: No immediate deadline but ongoing need for updated projections
- **Dependencies**: None - can start immediately; may inform capacity planning (PS-003)
- **Justification**: Current pain point with long lead time for interventions = high urgency

**Total Score**: (5 × 0.4) + (4 × 0.3) + (4 × 0.3) = **2.0 + 1.2 + 1.2 = 4.4**  
**Priority Assignment**: **P0 (Critical)**

- **Stakeholder urgency**: High - Cost control is persistent concern for MOH and Finance Ministry
- **Time sensitivity**: Medium-High - Budget planning cycles are annual; cost control policies needed
- **Policy deadlines**: Aligns with national budget cycle (ongoing)
- **Dependencies**: None - standalone analysis; may inform capacity investment (PS-003) by quantifying cost implications
- **Justification**: Perennial stakeholder priority with annual budget relevance

**Total Score**: (5 × 0.4) + (4 × 0.3) + (4 × 0.3) = **2.0 + 1.2 + 1.2 = 4.4**

## Prioritized Problem Statement Portfolio

### P0 (Critical) - Immediate Start Recommended

**1. PS-001: Healthcare Workforce Sustainability (Score: 4.4)**
- **Rationale**: Highest urgency + high business value; workforce shortages are current pain point with long lead time for solutions
- **Recommended Action**: Start immediately; allocate senior analyst with forecasting expertise
- **Resource Allocation**: High priority - dedicate resources for 5-7 sprints
- **Dependencies**: None - can proceed independently

**2. PS-004: Healthcare Expenditure Drivers (Score: 4.4)**  
*(tied with PS-001)*
- **Rationale**: Critical for financial sustainability; aligns with annual budget cycles; Finance Ministry priority
- **Recommended Action**: Start immediately (can run parallel with PS-001)
- **Resource Allocation**: High priority - dedicate economist/financial analyst for 4-6 sprints
- **Dependencies**: None - can proceed independently

**3. PS-002: Disease Burden Temporal Trends (Score: 4.0)**
- **Rationale**: Excellent feasibility (perfect data, low complexity) + solid business value; foundational for public health strategy
- **Recommended Action**: Start in Sprint 1-2 (after PS-001 and PS-004 initiated if resource-constrained)
- **Resource Allocation**: Medium priority - can assign mid-level analyst
- **Dependencies**: None - can proceed independently

### P1 (High) - Near-Term Start (Within 3-6 Months)

**4. PS-003: Healthcare Capacity Optimization (Score: 3.8)**
- **Rationale**: Highest business value (infrastructure investment impact) but lower urgency (long planning cycles) and moderate feasibility (data limitations, optimization complexity)
- **Recommended Action**: Start after P0 problem statements underway; requires optimization expertise
- **Resource Allocation**: Medium-High priority - allocate experienced analyst with operations research skills
- **Dependencies**: May benefit from PS-001 findings (workforce constraints affect capacity planning) but not blocking

### P2 (Medium) - Planned Start (6-12 Months)

**5. PS-005: Healthcare Access Equity (Score: 2.4)**
- **Rationale**: Important for social mission but constrained by data limitations (missing socioeconomic/ethnic variables); lower urgency (no pressing deadlines)
- **Recommended Action**: Defer until P0/P1 problem statements completed; consider data enhancement efforts first
- **Resource Allocation**: Low-Medium priority - assign when resources available
- **Dependencies**: None technical, but may benefit from first obtaining richer demographic data
- **Enhancement Opportunity**: **Recommend engaging MOH to obtain ethnicity and socioeconomic stratification data before starting** - would significantly increase feasibility and value

## Execution Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Sprint 1-3): P0 Critical Analyses - Parallel Execution
- **PS-001 (Workforce)**: Start immediately - Workforce planner + forecasting analyst
- **PS-004 (Expenditure)**: Start immediately - Financial analyst/economist
- **PS-002 (Disease Burden)**: Start Sprint 2 - Public health analyst (if resources permit parallel work)

### Phase 2 (Sprint 4-8): P1 High-Priority Analysis
- **PS-003 (Capacity)**: Start after PS-001/PS-004 initiated - Operations research analyst
- Continue/complete P0 analyses

### Phase 3 (Sprint 9-12): P2 Medium-Priority Analysis
- **PS-005 (Equity)**: Start when resources available; ideally after data enhancement
- Complete P1 analyses

### Parallel Execution Strategy
**PS-001, PS-002, PS-004 can run in parallel** (no dependencies):
- If resources available (3+ analysts), start all three simultaneously for maximum velocity
- If resource-constrained (1-2 analysts), prioritize PS-001 and PS-004 first (both score 4.4)

**PS-003 can start while P0 analyses are in progress** (no blocking dependencies):
- May benefit from PS-001 findings but not required
- Can proceed independently if optimization expertise available

**PS-005 should start last**:
- Lower priority and data limitations suggest deferral
- Recommend data enhancement efforts before starting

## Recommendations

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Initiate PS-001 and PS-004** as P0 Critical analyses - highest combined business value and urgency
2. **Allocate dedicated resources**: Senior analyst/forecaster for PS-001; Economist for PS-004
3. **Start PS-002 in Sprint 2** if resources permit - excellent feasibility makes it quick win

**Near-Term Planning**:
4. **Prepare for PS-003** (Capacity Optimization) - identify analyst with operations research skills; schedule for Sprint 4-5 start
5. **Socialize prioritization** with MOH stakeholders - validate priority assignments

**Future Enhancements**:
6. **For PS-005 (Equity)**: Engage MOH to request ethnicity and socioeconomic stratification data - would increase feasibility from 2/5 to 4/5 and business value from 3/5 to 4/5 (projected new score: 3.4 - P1 High)
7. **Monitor emerging priorities**: Healthcare landscape may change; reassess priorities quarterly
