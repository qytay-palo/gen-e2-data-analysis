## Key Features & Highlights

### INVEST Principles Compliance ✅
- **Independent**: Clear dependency mapping, can be developed separately where possible

- **Valuable**: Each story delivers tangible analytical outcome
- **Estimable**: Realistic effort estimates (S/M/L with day ranges)
- **Small**: All stories completable in 1-2 weeks
- **Testable**: Clear acceptance criteria with validation requirements

### Data Analysis Lifecycle Coverage ✅
All 7 stages covered across stories:
1. ✅ **Stage 1-2**: Data Extraction & Preparation (10 stories)
2. ✅ **Stage 3**: Exploratory Data Analysis (12 stories)
3. ✅ **Stage 4**: Feature Engineering (5 stories)
4. ✅ **Stage 5**: Advanced Analysis & Modeling (12 stories)
5. ✅ **Stage 6**: Validation & Evaluation (5 stories)
6. ✅ **Stage 7**: Visualization & Insights (5 stories)

### Domain Knowledge Integration ✅
All stories link to:
- `docs/domain_knowledge/healthcare-workforce-metrics-kpis.md`
- `docs/domain_knowledge/disease-burden-feature-engineering-guide.md`
- `docs/project_context/data-sources.md` (actual table names, no assumptions)

### Technical Standards ✅
- **Polars 0.20+ MANDATORY** for all data processing (as per project standards)
- Realistic effort estimates based on data volume and complexity
- ≥80% test coverage requirement for all critical logic
- loguru logging (NOT print statements)
- Pydantic schema validation

---

## Effort Summary

### Total Estimated Effort
- **PS-001 Workforce**: ~55-63 days
- **PS-002 Disease Burden**: ~42-48 days
- **PS-003 Capacity**: ~50-57 days
- **PS-004 Expenditure**: ~48-56 days
- **PS-005 Equity**: ~44-50 days

**Grand Total**: ~239-274 days (~11-13 months sequential, ~4-5 months parallel with 3 agents)

### Effort Distribution
- **Small (S)**: 15 stories × ~2.5 days = ~38 days
- **Medium (M)**: 27 stories × ~5 days = ~135 days
- **Large (L)**: 5 stories × ~8.5 days = ~43 days

---

## Decisions Made During Decomposition

### 1. Story Sequencing
- Strictly followed Data Analysis Lifecycle (extraction → EDA → modeling → validation → dashboard)
- Identified parallel execution opportunities (e.g., EDA stories can run concurrently after cleaning)

### 2. Granularity
- Kept stories to 2-10 day range (sprint-sized)
- Split large tasks (e.g., "forecasting" split into feature engineering + modeling + validation + scenarios)
- Combined very small tasks (e.g., extraction of related tables into single story)

### 3. Technical Approach
- **Workforce forecasting (PS-001)**: ARIMA/Prophet/regression models (industry standard for time series)
- **Disease trends (PS-002)**: Joinpoint regression for inflection detection (epidemiological best practice)
- **Capacity optimization (PS-003)**: Proxy occupancy metrics (data limitation workaround)
- **Expenditure decomposition (PS-004)**: LMDI method (preferred in health economics literature)
- **Equity analysis (PS-005)**: Concentration indices (WHO HEAT methodology)

### 4. Data Constraints Handling
- **Limited socioeconomic data (PS-005)**: Use age as proxy, document limitation
- **No bed occupancy data (PS-003)**: Calculate proxy using admissions × ALOS / capacity
- **Data ending 2019 (PS-001)**: Clear communication of COVID-19 caveat
- **National-level only**: Cannot assess regional disparities, document as limitation

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Review & validate**: Stakeholders review user stories, confirm priorities and estimates
2. **Sprint planning**: Organize stories into 2-week sprints (start with P0 extraction stories)
3. **Environment setup**: Configure Databricks, ensure Polars 0.20+, KaggleHub access
4. **Team assignment**: Assign stories based on skill sets (e.g., forecasting specialist for PS-001-US-06)

### Development Workflow
1. **Select story**: Pick from sprint backlog (prioritize P0, follow dependencies)
2. **Implement**: Follow implementation tasks checklist
3. **Test**: Achieve ≥80% coverage, pass acceptance criteria
4. **Document**: Update README, data dictionary, code docstrings
5. **Review**: Code review, demo to stakeholders, acceptance sign-off

### Quality Gates
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ ≥80% test coverage
- ✅ Data quality validation passed
- ✅ Documentation complete (docstrings, README, data dictionary)
- ✅ Stakeholder demo and acceptance

## Template Reuse Guide

### For Creating Additional Stories
The detailed stories (especially PS-001) provide complete templates that can be adapted for:
- Remaining PS-002 through PS-005 stories (follow same structure)
- Future problem statements (use as blueprint)
- Other data analysis projects

### Story Template Pattern
1. Copy structure from any PS-001 detailed story
2. Update header (Story ID, Epic, Title, Effort based on complexity)
3. Customize user story: As a [role specific to new problem], I want [specific capability], So that [specific value]
4. Adapt acceptance criteria to new analytical task
5. Link to relevant domain knowledge files
6. Update dependencies: data sources, upstream stories
7. Customize implementation tasks to new methodology
8. Add code examples in notes (preferably Polars)

## Challenges & Mitigations

### Identified Challenges
1. **Data recency**: Data ends 2019, now 7-year lag
   - **Mitigation**: Clearly communicate forecast uncertainty, recommend update when 2020+ data available
   
2. **Limited socioeconomic granularity**: No direct income/education stratification
   - **Mitigation**: Use age as proxy, document limitation, recommend future data collection
   
3. **Complexity of advanced stories**: Forecasting, decomposition require specialized skills
   - **Mitigation**: Allocate to experienced data scientists, provide domain knowledge resources
   
4. **Testing time series models**: Difficult to achieve 80% coverage for complex models
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on testing data processing logic, use mock data for model training tests
