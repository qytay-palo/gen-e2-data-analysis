You are a executor for the implementation plan. For each task:

# Single Task Delivery Pipeline

Deliver the task provided in `$ARGUMENTS` by orchestrating the agents below. Each agent is spawned using the **`runSubagent` tool** with its own isolated context. Agents communicate through shared documents in `docs/`, not through direct context passing — always pass file paths in the `prompt` parameter, never large code blocks.

Before starting, gather the following context:
- **Problem Statement**: `docs/objectives/problem_statements/ps-{num}-{name}.md`
- **User Story**: `docs/objectives/user_stories/problem-statement-{num}-{name}/` (Implementation details)
- **Domain Knowledge**: `docs/domain-knowledge/` — **MUST review and apply relevant guides**
- Create the following directory structure if it does not exist, and place all generated code artifacts in the correct locations:

### Directory Structure (MANDATORY)

**✅ CORRECT - All artifacts in ONE problem-statement directory:**
```
artifacts/ps-{num}-{descriptive-name}/
├── notebooks/              # ALL notebooks for this PS
├── src/                    # Problem-specific code
│   ├── data_processing/    # ETL and cleaning code
│   ├── analysis/           # Analysis modules
│   └── scripts/            # Executable scripts
├── data/                   # Problem-specific data
│   ├── 3_interim/          # Intermediate data
│   └── 4_processed/        # Final processed data
├── results/                # Analysis results
│   ├── tables/
│   └── metrics/
├── reports/                # Reports and figures
│   └── figures/
├── models/                 # Trained models
├── config/                 # Problem-specific config
├── tests/                  # Integration tests
├── logs/                   # Execution logs
└── README.md              # Execution instructions
```

ALWAYS pass the problem statement path to all `runSubagent` calls as context, and ensure each subagent understands the specific user story being implemented. This keeps all agents aligned on the same goal.

## Master Trigger Checklist

Before declaring delivery complete, confirm that `runSubagent` was called for **every** agent below. Check off each one as it completes:

| # | Agent | Phase | Triggered | Verified by code-quality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `data-extractor` | 1 | ☐ | ☐ |
| 2 | `data-validation` and `data-cleaning` | 2 | ☐ | ☐ |
| 3 | `exploratory-analysis` and `feature-engineer` | 3 | ☐ | ☐ |
| 4 | `model-forecasting` | 4 (if applicable) | ☐ / N/A | ☐ / N/A |
| 5 | `dashboard-visualization` | 5 | ☐ | ☐ |

> every non-N/A row must be checked. If any row is unchecked, trigger the missing agent now.

---

## Agent Completion Monitor

Before advancing to the next phase or agent, you MUST verify that the current agent has fully completed its task. Use the following protocol after **every** `runSubagent` call:

### Completion Check Protocol

For each agent, confirm ALL of the following before proceeding:

| Check | How to Verify |
|---|---|
| **Handoff JSON exists** | File at `docs/agent-handoffs/{phase}/ps-{num}-{name}/*.json` is present and non-empty (> 0 bytes) |
| **All claimed outputs exist** | Every file path listed inside the handoff JSON `outputs` array must exist on disk |
| **Notebooks are non-empty** | Any `.ipynb` listed must be > 1 KB and contain at least one executed cell with output |
| **No unhandled errors** | Handoff JSON `status` field must be `"success"` — any other value is a failure |
| **Data files are non-empty** | Any CSV/Parquet written must have at least 1 data row (not header-only) |

## Phase 7: Summary

**STOP**: Before writing the summary, verify the Master Trigger Checklist — every non-N/A row must show ☐ checked. If any subagent was skipped, trigger it now.

After all phases complete, present a delivery report:

```
## Story Delivery Report: [title]

### Artifacts
[List all the data files, notebooks, scripts, dashboards, and other deliverables created in this implementation]

### Files Changed
[list all created/modified source files]

### Code Quality Summary:
[summary of code quality improvements, simplifications, and fixes applied during code review]

### Status: READY FOR REVIEW | BLOCKED
```

## Rules

1. **`runSubagent` is mandatory for every agent** — never inline agent work in the main conversation.
2. **Parallel phases must use simultaneous `runSubagent` calls** — call both agents in the same invocation batch; do not call them sequentially.
3. **Sequential phases must wait** — always wait for `runSubagent` to return before starting the next phase.
4. **Agents communicate through files** — pass file paths in the `prompt` parameter, never paste code blocks.
5. **Run code-quality after EACH agent** — verify all claimed outputs exist and are non-empty. If verification fails, re-run the agent immediately with explicit fix instructions.
6. **code-reviewer MUST execute all notebooks** — every notebook must run top-to-bottom without errors. Cell ordering bugs (using undefined variables) = immediate failure and must be fixed.
7. **Respect the dependency chain** — phases 2b, 3b depend on upstream outputs; never start them before upstream `runSubagent` calls have returned.
8. **Empty notebooks = failed delivery** — notebooks < 1 KB or 0 cells must be recreated.
9. **Notebook cell order MUST be correct** — Constants/Paths → Data Loading → Functions → Main Logic. Variables must be defined before use.
10. **Update requirements.txt** with any new dependencies introduced during implementation.
11. **Master Trigger Checklist is mandatory** — confirm every applicable agent was triggered before writing the Phase 7 summary.
