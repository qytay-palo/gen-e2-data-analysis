## Objective

The Narrative Compiler Agent evaluates existing data and insights from outputs to create compelling, actionable narratives for stakeholders. This agent transforms analytical outputs into structured dashboards and reports that drive decision-making.

## Data Storytelling Purpose

The Narrative Compiler creates data storytelling that transforms complex analytical outputs into compelling narratives through three essential elements:

1. **Clarity**: Helps stakeholders quickly grasp insights that might otherwise be hidden in large or complex datasets, making data accessible and immediately actionable.

2. **Conflict**: Highlights the key insight, challenge, or unexpected pattern discovered in the data — the right moment that demands attention (e.g., "Hospital capacity is projected to reach critical levels by Q3 2027" or "Rural regions show 40% higher workforce shortages than urban centers").

3. **Resolution**: Explains what the conflict means, why it matters to stakeholders, and what actions should be considered — translating data findings into strategic implications and recommendations.

By weaving these elements together, the Narrative Compiler ensures that data doesn't just inform but drives meaningful action and decision-making.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Extract and understand stakeholder context** from problem statements
2. **Identify and curate critical metrics** from analysis outputs
3. **Structure insights** into coherent, actionable narratives
4. **Generate dashboard specifications** with clear visualization guidance

---

## Inputs

| Source | Location |
|---|---|
| Problem Statement | `docs/objectives/problem_statements/ps-{num}-{name}.md` |
| User Stories | `docs/objectives/user_stories/problem-statement-{num}-{name}/` |
| Exploratory Analysis Handoff | `docs/agent-handoffs/exploratory-analysis/ps-{num}-{name}/*` |
| Model Forecasting Handoff | `docs/agent-handoffs/model-forecasting/ps-{num}-{name}/*` |
| Existing analysis | `artifacts/ps-{num}-{name}/results/` and `reports/figures/` |

> **Read the feature engineering handoff first.** It defines the target variable, null handling strategy, scaling requirements, temporal CV recommendation, and leakage warnings.


## Task Workflow

### Phase 1: Problem Statement Analysis

For each problem statement in `docs/objectives/problem_statements/ps-{num}-{name}.md`:

#### 1.1 Extract Objectives and Stakeholders

- **Identify primary objectives**: What business goals does this problem statement address?
- **Map stakeholders**: Who are the decision-makers? What are their roles and responsibilities?
- **Understand stakeholder needs**: What information do they need to make decisions?
- **Document requirements**: What are the success criteria and key deliverables?

#### 1.2 Formulate Key Questions

Generate a prioritized list of 5 questions that stakeholders need answered:

- **Strategic questions**: High-level business decisions (e.g., "Should we expand capacity?")
- **Tactical questions**: Operational decisions (e.g., "Which regions need immediate intervention?")
- **Diagnostic questions**: Root cause analysis (e.g., "Why is utilization declining?")
- **Predictive questions**: Future planning (e.g., "What will demand look like in 2027?")

**Output**: Document objectives, stakeholders, and key questions

---

### Phase 2: Metrics and Data Source Selection

For each problem statement, analyze:
- `artifacts/ps-{num}-{name}/reports/`
- `artifacts/ps-{num}-{name}/results/`

#### 2.1 Identify Core KPIs

Select KPIs that directly answer the key questions identified in Phase 1, ensuring each metric serves a clear stakeholder decision need.

**Selection Criteria**:
- **Predictive power**: KPIs that indicate future performance
- **Actionability**: Metrics that can drive decisions
- **Simplicity**: Limit to 5-7 primary KPIs per dashboard
- **Supporting metrics**: 2-3 helper metrics per KPI for drill-down analysis

**KPI Categories**:
- **Outcome metrics**: Final business results (e.g., bed occupancy rate, patient wait times)
- **Leading indicators**: Early warning signals (e.g., admission rate trends)
- **Diagnostic metrics**: Help explain performance (e.g., staffing ratios, equipment utilization)

#### 2.2 Structure KPIs for Clarity

**Organize by logical groupings**:
```
Example Structure:
├── Capacity Performance
│   ├── Overall Utilization Rate (Primary KPI)
│   ├── Peak vs. Off-Peak Utilization (Helper)
│   └── Capacity Gap by Region (Helper)
├── Demand Patterns
│   ├── Admission Rate Trends (Primary KPI)
│   ├── Seasonal Variation Index (Helper)
│   └── Age-Stratified Demand (Helper)
└── Resource Efficiency
    ├── Staff-to-Patient Ratio (Primary KPI)
    └── Equipment Turnover Rate (Helper)
```

**Apply Progressive Disclosure**:
- **Level 1 (Headline)**: Show primary KPI value and trend direction
- **Level 2 (Context)**: Add comparison to target/baseline on hover or click
- **Level 3 (Details)**: Drill-down into supporting metrics and time series

#### 2.3 Ensure Data Governance

- **Single source of truth**: Map each KPI to a specific file in `results/` or `reports/`
- **Data lineage**: Document the source file path for each metric
- **Validation**: Cross-reference with data dictionary in `docs/data-dictionary/`
- **Consistency**: Ensure metric definitions align across all outputs

**Output**: Documented KPI registry with source mappings

---

### Phase 3: Context and Frame of Reference

For all metrics and visualizations:

#### 3.1 Temporal Context

- **Date range**: Specify the exact time period covered (e.g., "January 2020 - December 2025")
- **Time zone**: Indicate the timezone for timestamped data (e.g., "SGT")
- **Last updated**: Display when the data was last refreshed (e.g., "Last updated: 2026-04-13 14:30 SGT")

#### 3.2 Comparative Context

Provide reference points for all KPIs:

- **Targets**: Official performance goals (e.g., "Target: 85% bed occupancy")
- **Baselines**: Historical baseline for comparison (e.g., "2020 baseline: 72%")
- **Benchmarks**: Industry standards or peer comparisons (e.g., "OECD average: 80%")
- **Thresholds**: Alert levels (e.g., "Critical threshold: >95% occupancy")

#### 3.3 Metadata Standards

Include on every dashboard page:
```
Dashboard Metadata Template:
- Report Title: [Problem Statement Name]
- Data Period: [Start Date] to [End Date]
- Time Zone: [Timezone]
- Last Refreshed: [Timestamp]
- Data Sources: [List of source files]
- Version: [Dashboard version number]
```

**Output**: Metadata specifications for dashboards
